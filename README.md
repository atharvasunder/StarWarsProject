We developed an immersive and interactive embedded experience inspired by the Star Wars series. Our objective was to develop a creative, fun device for entertainment. Building on the theme of space, and inter-galactic warfare, we chose Star Wars, our favorite franchise as the theme. There is a high demand for replicas of lightsabers and experiences involving lightsabers, such as savvy’s workshop at Disney and lightsaber duels.
Through our project we aim to achieve all three and pack them into one budget friendly device. The project combines sensor-based customization with reaction-based gameplay. Users initiate the experience by placing a gummy bear with a color of their choosing into a color scanner, which sets the color of the lightsaber blade. Sequentially, the target board with Darth Vader sweeping his lightsaber in one of four, up, down, left, right, directions and the infamous soundtrack, Imperial March, will be play for the duration of the game. At given intervals, the vibration sensor in the hilt will give a haptic feedback to the user and the user has to parry Darth Vader’s attack by swinging the lightsaber in the opposite direction. The success or failure of the parrying move will be notified by the blade blinking white, or red. Once the music ends, the device will provide audiovisual feedback, lighting the blade in various colors and playing triumphant audio for victory and the “game over” sound effect for defeat.
